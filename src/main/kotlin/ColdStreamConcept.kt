// Flows are cold https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html#flows-are-cold
/**
 * Flows are cold streams similar to sequences â€” the code inside a flow builder does not run until the flow is collected.
 * This becomes clear in the following example: */

/**
 * This is a key reason the simple function (which returns a flow) is not marked with suspend modifier. The simple() call
 * itself returns quickly and does not wait for anything. The flow starts afresh every time it is collected and that is why we
 * see "Flow started" every time we call collect again. */

/**
 * Creates a cold flow from the given suspendable block. The flow being cold means that the block is called every time a
 * terminal operator is applied to the resulting flow. */

    println("Flow started")
    for (i in 1..3) {
        delay(100)
